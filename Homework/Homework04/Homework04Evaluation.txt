======================

Nice job on this assignment...
Here are a couple of observations and comments:

Your code looks great and thanks for doing headers!

These were from Jame's repo.

There are still some problems.

When I compile BinaryTree.java I get 19 compile errors, which
seem to be due to some confusion between Node and BinaryNode
classes.

Also, when I compile PriorityQ.java, it is looking for a Heap
class which isn't in your repo.  So I can't really do those
two programs.  You wrote code for them, though, so I'll give
you 1/2 credit on them both.

One thing to think about going forward:  WRITE MORE TESTS!
You can never do too much testing, as I've said.  Think about
it: you'd NEVER release an electronics board you've designed
without testing it thoroughly, right?  Or send a paper out for
publication with a mathematical algorithm you've developed
without making sure it works properly in all situations?  It
just makes good sense to verify that it all works, and that
it ALWAYS works....

..... just sayin'......
