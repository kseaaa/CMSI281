Homework03 Evaluation
======================

Nice work on this assignment!
Here are a couple of observations and comments:

Great job overall!  Try to write more into your test code, so
that you are testing things like negative values or lists that
are already sorted in reverse order.  You DID cover a sorted
list by re-using the sorted list from your first test and adding
more values on to it.  Good check on a single element list, and
a two-element list.

Good job on the Simon game.  It works fine, but was supposed to
ask the user if they want to play again, and if they say "yes",
reset and start over.  Also, the game should NOT have a new set
of letters for each round, but should just add one letter on to
the existing set each time until the user screws up.

Total credit is 13 for Sorter and either Simon or Huffman
 extra credit is 7 points for other of Simon or Huffman
-------------------------
 Grand total is 20 points for all three

you got 12.5 out of 13 which is 96.15% which is an A.
